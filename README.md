# CSMSS Website Sensitive Data Leakage Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a serious security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While searching through Google, I came across a **vulnerable directory** on the CSMSS website that is exposing sensitive student information. The directory contains various personal documents, including PDFs, Word files, and images, which are not secured and are accessible to unauthorized users.  

The vulnerable URL is:  
`https://csmss.org/admin/uploads/student/file/`

Here are some of the sensitive files that I was able to access:

- **Student PDFs**: Various personal documents (e.g., `2-student.pdf`, `3-student.pdf`, etc.)
- **Image Files**: (e.g., `10-student.jpg`, `74-student.jpg`)
- **Other Sensitive Files**: Multiple notices and other documents (e.g., `01-Notice.pdf`, `03Notice_MoU072024.pdf`)

This issue poses a significant risk to student privacy, and I believe it requires urgent attention to prevent further unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

## Steps
